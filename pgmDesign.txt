Objective
Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
What variables are required?
Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases
1. Find the average score
A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores, calculate the average score and display the result to the screen. The average score is calculated as the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.

Pseudo Code
Declare Integer exam_score
Declare Integer Sum
Declare Integer Avg

Option 1
Get Score from user 10 times
Get Sum of these 10 scores
Calculate the average value of these 10 scores
Display the average value to the user

Option 2
for (Integer counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++){
	Prompt user for exam_score
	Get exam_score
	Sum = Sum + exam_score
}
Avg = Sum/10
Display Avg


2. How much water runs off the roof
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

Pseudo Code
Assumptions: Overall inches of rainfall is one inch
Size of Roof = 600x240 inches square
Total Amount of rainfall on the roof is 600x240x1 = 144K in3 => Gallons = 144K in3/231

Declare Variables
Declare Integer roof_length = 640
Declare Integer roof_width = 240
Declare Integer gallon_conv_from_cubic_inches	= 231
Declare Integer avg_rainfall = 1		// amount of rainfall average
Declare Integer total_rainfall_cinches = 0	// amount of rainfull on a particular roof
Declare Float total_rainfall_gals = 0;
Declare Boolean finished = false;
Option 1

// Set default values
avg_rainfall = 1	// inches
roof_length = 640	// inches
roof_width = 240	// inches

While (not Finished){
	// Get Values from user
	avg_rainfall = GetAvgRainfall()	// inches
	roof_length = GetRoofLength()	// inches
	roof_width = GetRoofWidth()	// inches

	// Calculate total_rainfull
	total_rainfall_cinches = roof_length*roof_width*avg_rainfall 	// cubic inches
	total_rainfall_gals = total_rainfall_cinches/gallon_conv_from_cubic
	Display total_rainfall_gals
	finished = AskUserIfFinished()
}

Option 2
DoWhile (not Finished){
// Same as above
}

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

Write the pseudocode for the above problem. If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.
